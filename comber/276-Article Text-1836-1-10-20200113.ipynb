    "The last decade has heralded an unprecedented rise in the number, frequency and availability of data sources.  Yet they are often incomplete, meaning data fusion is required to enhance their quality and scope. In the context of spatial analysis, address matching is critical to enhancing household socio-economic and demographic characteristics. Matching administrative, commercial, or lifestyle data sources to items such as household surveys has the potential benefits of improving data quality, enabling spatial data visualisation, and the lowering of respondent burden in household surveys. Typically when a practitioner has high quality data, unique identifiers are used to facilitate a direct linkage between household addresses. However, real-world databases are often absent of unique identifiers to enable a one-to-one match. Moreover, irregularities between the text representations of potential matches mean extensive cleaning of the data is often required as a pre-processing step. For this reason, practitioners have traditionally relied on two linkage techniques for facilitating matches between the text representations of addresses that are broadly divided into deterministic or mathematical approaches. Deterministic matching consists of constructing hand-crafted rules that classify address matches and non-matches based on specialist domain knowledge, while mathematical approaches have increasingly adopted machine learning techniques for resolving pairs of addresses to a match. In this notebook we demonstrate methods of the latter by demonstrating the utility of machine learning approaches to the address matching work flow. To achieve this, we construct a predictive model that resolves matches between two small datasets of restaurant addresses in the US. While the problem case may seem trivial, the intention of the notebook is to demonstrate an approach that is reproducible and extensible to larger data challenges.  Thus, in the present notebook, we document an end-to-end pipeline that is replicable and instructive towards assisting future address matching problem cases faced by the regional scientist."

    "Our overarching objective is to demonstrate how machine learning can be integrated into the address matching work flow. By definition, address matching pertains to the process of resolving pairs of records with a spatial footprint. While geospatial matching links the geometric representations of spatial objects, address matching typically involves linking the text-based representations of address pairs. The utility of address matching, and record linkage in general, lies in the ability to unlock attributes from sources of data that cannot be linked by traditional means. This is often because the datasets lack a common key to resolve a join between the address of a premise. Two example applications of address matching uses include: the linkage of historical censuses across time for exploring economic and geographic mobility across multiple generations (Ruggles et al. 2018), and exploring how early-life hazardous environmental exposure, socio-economic conditions, or natural disasters impact the health and economic outcomes of individuals living in particular residential locations (Cayo & Talbot, 2003; Reynolds et al., 2003; Baldovin et al., 2015).\n",
    "\n",
    "For demonstrative purposes, we rely on small a set of addresses from the Fodors and Zagat restaurant guides that contain 112 matched addresses for training a predictive model that resolves address pairs to matches and non-matches. In a real-world application, training a machine learning model on a small sample of matched addresses could be used to resolve matches between the remaining addresses of a larger dataset. While we use the example of restaurant addresses, these could easily be replaced by addresses from a far less trivial source and the work flow required to implement the address matching exercise would remain the same. Therefore, it is the intention of this guide to provide insight on how the work flow of a supervised address matching work flow proceeds, and to inspire interested users to scale the supplied code to larger and more interesting problems."

    "Address matching is principally a data quality challenge. Similar to other areas of data analysis, when the quality of input data to the match classification is low, the output generated will typically be of low accuracy (Christen, 2012). Problematically, most address databases we encounter in the real world are inconsistent, are missing of several values, and lack standardisation. Thus, a first step in the address matching work flow is to increase the quality of input data. In this way we increase the accuracy, completeness and consistency of our address records, which increases the ease in which they can be linked by the techniques we apply later on. Typically this stage begins by parsing the text representations of addresses into rows of a dataframe."

    "A series of data cleaning exercises will then modify the data in ways that support the application of the linkage techniques. This might involve writing data cleaning scripts that convert all letters to lowercase characters, delete leading and trailing whitespaces, remove unwanted characters and tokens such as punctuation, or using hard-coded look-up tables to find and replace particular tokens. All together coding these steps contributes towards a standard form between the two address databases the user is attempting to match. This is important because standards between the two sources of address data under consideration will typically differ due to different naming conventions.\n",

    "After removing unwanted characters and tokens, our next step is to segment the entire address string into tagged attribute values. Addresses rarely come neatly formatted into sensible fields that identify each component, and so segmentation is a vital and often overlooked stage of the work flow. For example, an address might come in an unsegmented format such as \"19 Water St. New York 11201\". Our objective is then to segment (or label) this address into the appropriate columns for street number, street name, city and postcode. When we segment both sets of addresses from the datasets we intend to link, we build well-defined output fields that are suitable for matching. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our case we use a statistical segmentation tool called __Libpostal__ which is a Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) model trained on OpenStreetMap addresses. Before using the Python bindings, users are required to install the Libpostal C library first (see https://github.com/openvenues/pypostal#installation for installation instructions). CRFs are popular methods in natural language processing (NLP) for predicting sequence of labels across sequences of text inputs. Unlike discrete classifiers, CRFs model the probability of a transition between labels on \"neighbouring\" elements, meaning they take into account past and future address field states into the labelling of addresses into address fields. This mitigates a limitation of segmentation models such as hidden markov models (HMMs) called the _label bias problem_: \"transitions leaving a given state to compete only against each other, rather than against all transitions in the model\" (Lafferty et al., 2001). Take, for example, the business address for \"1st for Toys, 244 Ponce de Leon Ave. Atlanta 30308\". A naive segmentation model would incorrectly parse \"1st\" as a property number, whereas it actually completes the business name \"1st for Toys\", leading to an erroneous sequence of label predictions. When a CRFs has parsed \"1st\" and reaches the second token, \"for\", the model scores an $l\\times l$ matrix where $l$ is the maximal number of labels (or address fields) that can be assigned by the CRFs. In $L$, $l_{ij}$ reflects the probability of the current word being labelled as $i$ and the previous word labelled $j$ (Diesner & Carley, 2008). In a CRFs model, when the parser reaches the _actual_ property number, \"244\", high scoring in the matrix indicates the current label should be a property number, and the previous label revised to a business name. For a more detailed account, see Comber and Arribas-Bel (2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "To segment each address, we apply the `parse_address` function row-wise for both the Zagat and Fodors addresses. This generates a list of tuples (see below code block for an example of the first two addresses from the Zagat dataset) that we convert into dictionaries before finally reading these into a `pandas` dataframe."

    "Once our addresses have met a particular standard of quality and are segmented into the desired address fields, the next step requires us to create candidate pairs of addresses that potentially resolve to the same address. In record linkage, this step is typically called indexing or blocking, and is required to reduce the number of address pairs that are compared. In doing so we remove pairs that are unlikely to resolve to true matches. To demonstrate the utility of blocking and why it is so important to address matching, we first create a __full index__ which creates all possible combinations of address pairs. More concretely, a full index generates the Cartesian product between both sets of addresses. Conditional on the size of both dataframes, full blocking is highly computationally inefficient, and in our case we create $112\\times 112 = 12544$ candidate links; this has a complexity of $O(n^2)$. We demonstrate the full index method to motivate the desire for practitioners to implement more sophisticated blocking techniques.  "

Once we observe which address fields are common to both datasets, we create so-called comparison vectors from candidate address pairs of the Zagat and Fodor datasets. Each element of the comparison vector represents the string similarity between address fields contained in both databases. For example, `city_jaro` describes the string similarity between the columns `city_zagat` and `city_fodor`. Looking at the first two rows of our comparison vectors dataframe, a `city_jaro` value of 1.00 implies an exact match whereas a value of 0.4040 implies a number of modifications are required to match the two city names, and so these are less likely to correspond to a match."

As a reminder, a random forest is generated using a multitude of decision trees during training which then outputs the mode of the match status decision for the individual trees. \n",

    "To evaluate the performance of our built classification model, we use 10-fold cross-validation meaning the performance measures are averaged across the test sets used within the 10 folds. We use three metrics that are commonly used to evaluate machine learning models. Recall measures the proportion of address pairs that should have been classified, or recalled, as matched (Christen, 2012). The precision (or, equivalently, the positive predictive value) calculates the proportion of the matched address pairs that are classified correctly as true matches (Christen, 2012). Finally, the F1 score reflects the harmonic mean between precision and recall. Our cross-validation exercise is executed in the following cell."

    "While a Cartesian product could be useful in a linkage exercise where we have a very small number of matched addresses, in production environments more sophisticated techniques are generally required to create candidate address links. This is particularly the case when we have a large number of addresses. Thus, blocking is typically introduced to partition the set of all possible address comparisons to within mutually exclusive blocks. If we let $b$ equal the number of blocks, we reduce the complexity of the comparison exercise to $O(\\frac{n^2}{b})$, which is far more computationally tractable than the full index method used above.\n",
    "\n",
    "When deciding which column to use as a blocking key we generally need pay attention to two main considerations. Firstly, we pay attention to attribute data quality. Typically when identifying a blocking key, we choose a key that has a __low number of missing values__. This is because choosing a key with many missing values forces a large number of addresses into a block where the key is an empty value, which may lead to many misclassified address matches. And secondly we pay attention to the __frequency distribution__ of attribute values. We optimise towards a uniform distribution of values, as typically skewed distributions that result in some values occurring very frequently mean that these values will dominate the candidate pairs of address generated. \n",

    "The postcode attribute looks like a sensible choice of blocking key because it contains just one missing value and there are very low numbers of candidate address comparisons within each block. As you can see in the output below, when we use a more sophisticated indexing technique we generate a far lower number of candidate address comparisons. In fact, we create only 1014 candidate address links despite adding synthetic non-matches (discussed below). Overall, our introduction of blocking substantially lowers the computational requirement of the linkage task."

    "To make this exercise more realistic, let's also create 112 synthetic non-matches so we have 224 addresses in total. This will also be important for training our machine learning technique to learn the representations of non-matched addresses in addition to matches. In this case we use the FEBRL data set generator script `generate.py` to create an artificially generated dataset (see http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~Peter.Christen/Febrl/febrl-0.3/febrldoc-0.3/node70.html). The script uses Python 2.7, so we read the output as JSON so the user does not have to rely on an external input. We do this in keeping with a self-contained notebook but describe the steps required to reproduce the non-matches below. \n",
    "\n",
    "The synthetic non-matches are essentially random permutations of the matched addresses. These are constructed on the basis of frequency tables for each address field that count the occurrence of particular values. For example, the first row of a frequency table for a house number would look like: $<$house_number_attribute_value$>$,$<$frequency_of_occurence$>$."

    "`generate.py` takes six parameters that are used to create non-matched addresses. The first argument demarcates the number of original records to be generated; the second specifies the number of duplicate records from the original to be generated; and the third, fourth and fifth arguments define the maximal number of duplicate records that will be created based on one original record, the maximum number of modifications introduced to the address field, and the maximum number of modifications introduced to the address, respectively. The final parameter is used to enter which probability distribution will be to create duplicate records - i.e. uniform, poisson, or zipf. In our case we are only interested in building synthetic non-matches (and not duplicates), so we set the number of original records to be built as 112, the number of duplicates generated as 0, and leave the number of modifications introduced by the recommended default settings.\n",

This is because non-matched addresses would be constructed from the frequency tables of each zipcode block, meaning each non-match would share more commonality to actual matched addresses. In practice, this would improve the predictive power of our classification model to disambiguate between candidate address pairs that have very subtle differences yet are still matched or non-matched."

    "Overall, our precision value implied 85% of true positives were correctly separated from false positives, and our recall value indicated that 88% of all true address matches were successfully retrieved, with the remaining 12% incorrectly classified as non-matches. With our model now fitted and tested, we could extend its use to predict the match status of unseen address pairs. As an example application, if we had a small sample of matched addresses that belonged to a larger set of unmatched addresses, we could use our trained predictive model to match the remaining addresses in the dataset. This would work so long as the textual representations of addresses used in the prediction stage follow a similar structure to those addresses used to train the classification model.\n",

    "Before we conclude, a benefit of using ensemble methods such as random forest classifiers is that we can return an indication of how useful and valuable each feature was in the construction of each decision tree. In a practical application, extracting a measure of feature importance might be a useful step in pruning redundant features from the comparison vectors. This might be a useful step in lowering computation times as we decrease the number of address field comparisons required to evaluate candidate address pairs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, in the following code block we rank feature importance of particular address fields to the match classification. "

    "Address matching is a data enrichment process that is increasingly required in wide-ranging, real-world applications. For example, matching between census, commercial or lifestyle records has the potential benefit of improving data quality, enabling spatial data visualisation and joining data that would otherwise remain isolated in data silos. In absence of unique identifiers for directly linking data, practitioners have typically relied on statistical linkage methods for matching addresses. Linking address datasets in this way has the potential to unlock attributes that one would be unable to access in circumstances where no primary keys exist to join the two datasets. Thus, in this notebook, we documented the steps required to execute the work flow for an address matching exercise that utilised new and recent innovations in machine learning. While the dataset we used was low volume, the intention of the notebook was to demonstrate an approach that is reproducible within a self-contained environment, and which might be adapted by the interested user to larger data challenges. Training a predictive model to link restaurant addresses may seem a trivial problem to solve, but these addresses could easily be replaced by more meaningful address records in areas such as public health and socio-economic mobility studies. Therefore, the core contribution of this notebook sought to equip the regional scientist with skills necessary to extend the address matching work flow to their own (and far more interesting) use cases."
